## Technichal Features
- Primarily utilized UIKit and supplemented with SwiftUI for App development.
- Integrated ARKit, Vision and CoreML for a machine learning model to interpret and
respond to users' current emotions.
- Applied SwiftUI Charts for data visualization and user interaction.
- Integrated Apple Music API and AVFoundation for multimedia features.
- Incorporated OpenAI API as an AI consultant to read and analyze users' emotion diaries.
- Used Firebase Database for backend services and implemented Sign in with Apple/
Firebase Authentication for user authentication.
- Utilized Closure, and NotificationCenter, Combine for data passing and binding.
- Used third-party libraries, including Lottie, Alamofire, and IQKeyboardManager.

## Requirements
- Xcode 15.2
- A real iOS device running iOS 17 (the AR feature requires a real device and won't work on the simulator)
